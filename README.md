Description:

A collision game where a player tries to avoid falling objects causing ‘harm’ and collect ‘points’ to move onto next level.

As the level increases, the speed of the falling objects and players speed increases

A harm and a benefit character move across the screen from top to bottom, and upon collision with the player will either reduce game lives or increase score.

This project includes combination of blocks, conditional statements and loops.
